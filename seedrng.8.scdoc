SEEDRNG(8)

# NAME

seedrng - seed the Linux kernel random number generator

# SYNOPSIS

*seedrng*

# DESCRIPTION

The *seedrng* utility seeds the Linux kernel random number generator
(RNG) from stored seed files.
It takes no arguments and must be run as root.

The kernel RNG cannot be initialized directly from shell scripts, and
boot-time entropy is often limited.
*seedrng* solves this by saving and restoring seed files across
reboots.

It should be run once at system startup and once at shutdown.
Running it at other times is harmless.
Each run loads existing seed files into the RNG and then writes a new
seed file.

If the RNG has sufficient entropy when the new seed file is created,
it is marked *creditable* and may be used to initialize the RNG later.
Otherwise, it is marked *non-creditable*.
Both types contribute to the RNG pool.

New seeds are generated by mixing fresh entropy with a hash of the old
seed and system-specific data, so entropy never decreases.

# ENVIRONMENT

*SEEDRNG_SKIP_CREDIT*
	When set to *1*, *true*, *yes* or *y*, prevents marking new
	seed files as creditable.

# FILES

_/var/lib/seedrng_
	Directory containing seed files used across reboots.

_/var/lib/seedrng/seed.credit_
	Creditable seed file, may initialize the RNG.

_/var/lib/seedrng/seed.no-credit_
	Non-creditable seed file, used to mix into the RNG pool.

# EXIT STATUS

*0* on success, *>0* on error.
